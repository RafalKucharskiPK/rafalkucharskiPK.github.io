title: Anastasia & Onur at ICLR2024

[**Anastasia**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasia-psarou) and [**Onur**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aonurakman) during their first conference since they joined COeXISTENCE team! At [**ICLR 2024**](https://iclr.cc/) they both had an opportunity to update knowledge on the learning representations and hold discussions with not only academic staff and industrial researchers, but also other students. I am confident that the experience gained this year will bring benefits. 

[Just look at these happy faces!](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/rafalkucharskipk.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdf/ICLR.pdf)
