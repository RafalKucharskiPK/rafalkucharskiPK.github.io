After 2+ years, finally in person meeting with the community [**hEART**](https://transp-or.epfl.ch/heart/2022.php) conference in Leuven. Six contributions from our side (Arkadiusz Drabicki, Michal Bujak, Marko Maričić, Peyman Ashkrof, Arjan de Ruijter and Farnoud Ghasemi presented results of our joint work). Plus a great keynote by prof. Oded Cats, summarizing roughly all on which our lab is founded, including [ExMAS](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS/) and [MaaSSim](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim).
