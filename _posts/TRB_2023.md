This week we present two posters on the [TRB](https://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) in Washington. Farnoud [presents](/./assets/pdf/FarnoudTRB_poster.pdf)  how to simulate market entry of Uber and Usman (or me on his behalf) presents what [we found out](/./assets/pdf/usman_poster.pdf) about complexity of ride-pooling problems - see you at our sessions in DC!
