ðŸ—ž _Complex social systems simulations â€“ human behavior modeling_, lecture on [**Friday at Auditorium Maximum**]( https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7178375135991631873/)


I will be talking about how challenging is introducing the human factor into models and simulations considering humans have their unpredictability and free will what makes simulations more complex. The main question is how do we incorporate these aspects into modeling. Together with the audience I will go on a journey through various examples, from road traffic to pedestrian traffic simulations, presenting how human decisions can shape social phenomena. Finally, I will show how to use artificial intelligence in simulations where people compete for limited resources with intelligent machines.

See you there!
