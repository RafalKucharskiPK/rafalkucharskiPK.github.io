Two conferences at the same time.... At **INSTR** in the (virtual) Stockholm we present our work lately published in Transportmetrica:A: [_If you are late, everyone is late: late passenger arrival and ride-pooling systems' performance_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23249935.2020.1829170).
Today the MT-ITS conference started - see our [presentation](/./assets/pdf/INSTR_LatePooling.pdf) with Oded Cats, Andres Fielbaum and Javier Alonso-Mora.
