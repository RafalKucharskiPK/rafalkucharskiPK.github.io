Today our [#COeXISTENCE lab](https://rafal-kucharski.u.matinf.uj.edu.pl/COeXISTENCE/) met with [**prof. Gunnar Flötteröd**](https://liu.se/en/employee/gunfl93) from Linköping University. We presented our thought on the traffic equilibria, surprisingly a lot of open research questions in this classical problem, specifically in the context of #CAV - great opportunity.
