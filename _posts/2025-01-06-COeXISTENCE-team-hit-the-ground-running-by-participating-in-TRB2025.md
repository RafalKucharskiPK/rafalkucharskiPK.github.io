ðŸ“¢ It is becoming our tradition to begin the New Year at [**TRB Annual Meeting**](https://trb-annual-meeting.nationalacademies.org/). On 6th of January in Washington [ZoltÃ¡n](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/zoltan_varga/) and [Grzegorz](https://www.rafalkucharskilab.pl/research/grzegorz_jamroz/) presented our poster titled _Framework to Measure Properties of Microscopic Traffic Equilibria_ 
It shows what we called **Routing ZOO** (a sumo-based framework) thanks to which we want to check what Microscopic Traffic Assignment really is: what are its properties, stability, is it equilibrium etc.

Draft repo, that soon we will use for bigger experiments, is [here:](https://lnkd.in/dC9Ss6D5).
