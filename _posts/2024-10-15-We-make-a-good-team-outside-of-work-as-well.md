Last Saturday we took part in Run for a Good Cause 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ - a charity event organised by the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science to support [Tadzio Kaminski](https://www.siepomaga.pl/tadek-kaminski), the son of our colleague. 
The competition has faded into the background, it was a great chance to help those in need and have fun while doing this. Our team composed of [four](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7251493344629932032/?actorCompanyId=103209276) did a good job!
