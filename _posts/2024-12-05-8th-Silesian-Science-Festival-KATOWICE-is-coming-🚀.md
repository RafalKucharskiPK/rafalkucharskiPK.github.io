At first view, the city's transport system is a complex technical structure filled with machines 🚙 (vehicles) and engineering 🛣 (roads, tracks, bridges, etc.) - managed by engineers and algorithms. Nothing could be more wrong! Engineering only sets the boundary conditions here, but the main actors are us, **people**. Our decisions (what, when, which way and where I will go) determine the shape of this complex system. 
During **8th Silesian Science Festival KATOWICE** [Rafal](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/research/rafal_kucharski/) will show it on a few examples, discuss two Nobel Prizes, including one in game theory, which we are currently playing among ourselves, but ... soon will start playing with artificial intelligence 🤹‍♂️
Join us **this Saturday, 7th December. Starting at 1:10 PM**.
