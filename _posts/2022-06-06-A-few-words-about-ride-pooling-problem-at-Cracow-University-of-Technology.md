I presented the Ride-Pooling problem at our flagship national conference [Modelling 2022](https://nbi.com.pl/kalendarium/modelling-22-modelowanie-podrozy-i-prognozowanie-ruchu/) at Cracow University of Technology. 
Good opportunity to introduce my team and research problems to exceptional practitioners involved in most challenging infrastructure projects in the country - [_slides_](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/Kucharski_pooling_modelling2022.pdf)
