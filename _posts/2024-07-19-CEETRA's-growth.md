Last year at Jagiellonian University we set up the **CEETRA** (Central European Excellence in Transportation Research Association) initiative and good to see it's growing. This year in Vienna we participated in two [research sessions](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/CEETRA%202024.jpg) and discussed the future of the association. 

If you are scientist with ambitions to make impact on transportation research, and you are from CEE (by location, origin or heart ðŸ’›) [reach us out](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/CEETRA%202024%20all.jpg)!
