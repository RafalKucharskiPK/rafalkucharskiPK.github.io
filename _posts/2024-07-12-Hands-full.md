Next week we present our [_**ride-Pooling experiment**_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2023.103767) at IATBR International Conference on Travel Behavior in Vienna - we will show the potential of pooling with our ExMAS approach on 1.5 million trips from 6 months in NYC. Later we join [**2nd CEETRA meeting**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ceetra-association/), where [**Michal Bujak**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-bujak-836602182/) will present his pricing algorithm for ride-pooling. See you in Vienna! ‚úàÔ∏èüöá
