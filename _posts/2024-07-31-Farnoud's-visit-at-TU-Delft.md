[Farnoud](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/research/farnoud_ghasemi/) has completed his 3-months PhD visit at TU Delft!

During his visit, he had the privilege of working directly with Professor Oded Cats and together they initiated a new research project. Huge thanks to Peyman Ashkrof, Ph.D. and Arjan de Ruijter for their assistance. Looking forward to work on the material that Farnoud created in Delft!
