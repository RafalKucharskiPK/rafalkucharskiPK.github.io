ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš— We are proud to share our achievements in urban traffic dynamics at [**17th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning**](https://ewrl.wordpress.com/ewrl17-2024/).
Meet [Onur](https://rafal-kucharski.u.matinf.uj.edu.pl/research/onur_akman/) and [Anastasia](https://rafal-kucharski.u.matinf.uj.edu.pl/research/anastasia_psarou/) who are proving that RL-enabled autonomous vehicles can optimize behavioral objectives by learning to choose better routes! 
[Just take a look how we came to this conclusion] (https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/assets/img/EWRL 2024.jpg) ðŸ‘ˆ
