🗞 When ride-pooling is attractive/efficient for all the parties involved (passengers, platforms/providers, city/environment/sustainability)?

We examined half a year (1.5 million trip sample) from NYC, run 9 000 experiments with our 𝐄𝐱𝐌𝐀𝐒 and report 6 KPIs to move beyond the well-known 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐬 and better understand ride-pooling potential.
