**Info about myself** 

I am an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Jagiellonian University in Krakow. Currently working as part of a group led by Prof. Rafal Kucharski at the PI position in a EU co-funded Seamless Shared Urban Mobility (SUM) project that aims to help cities integrate New & Shared Modes with public transport. Before that I was part of the team under the NCN Opus Grant on Shared Mobility in pandemic times.
