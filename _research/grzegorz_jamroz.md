1. I  defended my PhD in mathematics at University of Warsaw (Poland) in 2015. My research experience includes internships at University of Heidelberg (Germany) and postdoc positions at University of Warwick (UK), University of Basel (Switzerland) and Institute of Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. I am passionate about natural sciences, traveling, learning natural languages, cycling and hiking in the mountains (especially in the Alps). 

2. My scientific interests revolve around mathematical modeling and analysis of real-world systems. I have developed and studied models of the biological process of cell differentiation and studied partial differential models originating in fluid mechanics. In 2023 I joined COeXISTENCE at Jagiellonian University where I am leveraging his skills and expertise in the field of artificial intelligence in transportation. My current interests are focused on human and machine learning as well as human-machine interaction.
