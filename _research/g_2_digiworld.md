> Fully funded tenure-track professor position at Group of Machine Learning

With this grant I enjoy a three-year fully funded assistant professor position to collaborate with Group of Machine Learning af Faculty of Mathematics. 
We explore intersections between AI/ML and modern ubran mobility. 
We employ Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks and Deep Learning to solve urban mobility problems (flow, speed, route, demand, etc.). 
We are opened for (potentially funded) Master Student projects - see active opened projects (here)[https://gmum.net/]
