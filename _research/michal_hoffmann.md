bio: I am a graduate of the applied mathematics at the Jagiellonian University. During my studies, I focused mostly on the probability theory (master’s thesis on the construction of the Wiener process), statistics and graph theory (bachelor’s thesis on the equivalence of Konig’s and Hall’s theorems). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the technical computer science at the same university

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Theoretical Computer Science at Jagiellonian University. My research focuses on competition in the transportation, where I combine Game Theory with Machine Learning to explore the impact of conflicts on everyday commuter. I love to work on intersection of various fields where I can use sometimes unorthodox methods solving my problems.

Outside of the lab I enjoy mountain trekking and I never pass up a good book!
