bio: I am a graduate of the applied mathematics at the Jagiellonian University. During my studies, I focused mostly on the probability theory (master’s thesis on the construction of the Wiener process), statistics and graph theory (bachelor’s thesis on the equivalence of Konig’s and Hall’s theorems). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the technical computer science at the same university
