1. I am a graduate of the applied mathematics at the Jagiellonian University. During my studies, I focused mostly on the probability theory (master’s thesis on the construction of the Wiener process), statistics and graph theory (bachelor’s thesis on the equivalence of Konig’s and Hall’s theorems). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the technical computer science at the same university. 

2. My main field of expertise is the application of network science in the ride-pooling problem. My first contribution is the formalisation of network structures present in the algorithmic approach and the introduction of weighted structures. Later, I applied probabilistic tools to analyse the impact of behavioural heterogeneity of travellers on the system performance. Currently, I am working on the application of graph neural networks in the ride-pooling.
