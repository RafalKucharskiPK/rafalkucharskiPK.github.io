I am currently a PhD student within the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the Jagiellonian University. My PhD research under the supervision of Prof. Rafal Kucharski, focuses on studying behavioural dynamics of two-sided mobility using agent-based microsimulation.  
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Tabriz and completed my MSc degree in Transport Systems at the Sapienza University of Rome. I did my Master’s thesis in collaboration with CriticalMaas group of TU Delf, on the ride acceptance behavour of ride-sourcing drivers, under supervision of Prof. Guido Gentile and Prof. Rafal Kucharski. 

Research interests: Transportation modeling, Mobility as a Service, Two-sided mobility market, Agent-based modelling, Multi-agent systems
