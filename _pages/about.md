I research complex social systems: **urban mobility**. Congested, urban multimodal networks used by millions of agents to reach their destinations and leaving huge sets of mobility traces ready to be applied for modelling, optimization, understanding and control. Full [CV](/assets/pdf/cv_eng_2022.pdf)

Currently, I run the **ERC Starting Grant COeXISTENCE** where I bridge between ML and transportation - we simulate how intelligent machines compete with humans for limited urban resources (space) and what can we expect. See details [here](https://rafalkucharskipk.github.io/COeXISTENCE/)
I am **Assistant Professor** in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of **Jagiellonian University** in Krakow (Poland) with the **Group of Machine Learning Research** [GMUM](http://www.gmum.net). I run the *NCN Opus Grant* on Shared Mobility in the pandemic times, *ERC StG* and *Horizon Europe* projects.

Before, I worked (2019-2021) with prof. Oded Cats at TU Delft in his ERC Starting Grant [Critical MaaS](http://smartptlab.tudelft.nl/projects/criticalmaas). I modelled two-sided mobility platforms, specifcally focusing on ride-pooling ([ExMAS](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/ExMAS)) and agent-based simulator for Uber-like systems ([MaaSSim](https://github.com/RafalKucharskiPK/MaaSSim)). I did PhD at Cracow University of Technology with an excellent goup of prof. [Andrzej Szarata](http://www.kst.pk.edu.pl/) and working closely with [Guido Gentile](https://www.dicea.uniroma1.it/users/guidogentileuniroma1it) from La Sapienza on non-equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment. In the interdisciplinary field of _urban mobility_ I did research which can be classified as: 
* model estimation, optimization, system control, network design;
* agent-based simulation, game-theory, network science, stochastic simulation, epidemic modelling;
* machine learning, spatial analysis, big data analysis, pattern recognition, unsupervised learning;
* behavioural modelling, economic discrete choice models, policy, sustainability.
